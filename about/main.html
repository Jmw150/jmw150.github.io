I am a logician.

At the end of the day, I think logic is a core discipline that helps us most when navigating the world and growing as individuals. There are other methods of understanding things. But logic is the most beautiful and powerful to me.

Career wise I am both a mathematics and computer science researcher (mildly tautological). My specific field is automated reasoning systems. This overlaps with the PL community (POPL/PLDI/OOPSLA), Formal Methods community (CAV/TACAS) and ML community (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR).

But there is a lot to love in the modern sciences. I am slowly completing a masters level understanding of pure mathematics, physics, and philosophy. I like writing mathematical proofs in languages like Coq, programming language theory, AI systems, converging function spaces, higher structures, and foundational theories.
