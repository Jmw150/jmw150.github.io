<p> I am a logician.  </p>

<p> 
    I think logic is a core discipline that helps us most when navigating the world and growing as individuals. There are other methods of understanding things. But logic is the most beautiful and powerful to me.  
</p>
<p> My specific fields of logic are program synthesis and program verification. This overlaps with the PL community (POPL/PLDI/OOPSLA), Formal Methods community (CAV/TACAS) and ML community (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR).  </p>

<p> Favorite intro books right now : 
</p><p> Mathematical Logic - Elliot Mendelson (emphasis on intro) 
</p><p> Algebra - Dummit, and Foot 
</p><p> Topology - Theodore Gamelin
