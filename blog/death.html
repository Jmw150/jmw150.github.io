<h2>Death</h2>

Research to live longer, is amazing. More people should do it.<br><br>

Death happens. I do not take it as inevitable, or fun right of passage. Getting
old sucks. People die for reasons. Also, as an American in the current decade,
my possible reasons are cardiovascular failure or cancer. War and famine has
not been a common cause of death, for as long as anyone has been alive, in the
USA. Hope it stays that way. Aside from the work of police, military, and
medical staff to keep people safe and healthy, the next tier is research. <br><br>
Well that and now plague prevention. That is why Covid, and future contagions, are a big deal to me. As a non-boring American, there is another 
<a  href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html"

>50+ years</a>
of solving useful problems I would miss out on, if I just up and died. Writing a good piece of work, like a thesis, is a decade long project. Many people get to make one of these novel contributions that are not seen anywhere in all 8 billion other people experience. And I could have 70+ years or 100+ of doing stuff like that. This research is valuable.<br><br>
The Covid death numbers seem low, compared to billions of living people, but it was
the third most life threatening thing out there to Americans. Yeah, I stayed
home and took the MRNA based vaccine. MRNA vaccines are a cool technology. More
people should be programming MRNA to fight off these inconvenient little shits. <br><br>

But what about cardiovascular problems and cancer? Fuck them. Forget horror
movies. Being home alone and having my heart suddenly fail is the realistic
nightmare. And it is also a boring death. These problems are successfully being
combatted with medicine.  Cardiovascular research is heavily funded. As I get
older I will continue to follow medical advice on keeping the pipes working. <br><br>
Cancer is a bit more tricky, but also leads into a massive wealth of medical
science. Fixing the cancer problem requires knowing a lot more about how our
cell do things. As seen by the chart above, cardio issues are decreasing over
time, up to the point where they match cancer. Cancer has barely moved up or
down. That is what is next on the medical scientist's chopping block. Cancer is
also never pleasant or quick. Consider these upstart cells to be the next major
villains of this century. Be the hero. Learn oncology. If that does not sound
fun for you, fund Oncology departments, like the <a
