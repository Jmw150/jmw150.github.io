<h2>Ever Notice How Things Are Less Mystical In Person</h2>
I read through popular books on physics by physicists, and physics research by mathematical or theoretical physicists. math-physics and computational-physics are written by people with similar brains to mine. So, I am half qualified anyway to say these things.<br><br>
Stuff like the big bang sounds very scientific. There is arrow of time, particles/waves, one electron universe, etc.. But these things are a lot less sound when you read how the author came up with them. They sound more like regular ideas that anyone could have. It could all be bees, or ducks that make up the universe as well. <br><br>
What makes physical theories stand out as not terribly arbitrary is that people 'poke at the universe' to confirm these theories. But the data is interpreted and theorized about as much as the ideas that motivated the search for the data. And there are multiple interpretations for a piece of data. So the next step to the thing is that an interpretation needs to be predictive. This helps narrow down theories more. But this does not remove the circularity initially created by theorizing about the data. It only helps to constrain it. It is also odd in the sense that the first theory has more value than subsequent, and possibly better thought, out theories.<br><br>
There is another issue too, there is too much going on. So a theory and its evidence are just a whisper of what happened after being passed around so much. Full grown adults can then tell tall tales, because they trust someone else's truth instead of verifying it for themselves. This is what makes physical theories less serious looking in person. We all seem to live in the past (duh), and in a much more simple universe in our heads. It is all so.. suboptimal.<br><br>
Anyway, when science sounds magical, that is because it started out as part of someone's imagination. We could do statistical tests on the sillier theories first, while we are at it. Leave a more magical world-view for future generations.<br><br>
