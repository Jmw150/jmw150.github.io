  <h2>ever notice how things are less mystical in person</h2>
I read through popular books on physics by physicists, and physics research by
mathematical or theoretical physicists. math-physics and computational-physics are written by people with similar brains to mine. So, I am half qualified anyway to say these things.<br><br>
Stuff like the big bang sounds very scientific. There is arrow of time,
particles/waves, one electron universe, etc.. But these things are a lot less
sound when you read how the author came up with them. They sound more like
regular ideas that anyone could have. It could all be bees, or ducks that make
up the universe as well. Respect for authority is kind of bigotry.<br><br>
What makes it stand out as not terribly arbitrary is that people 'poke at the
universe' to confirm these theories. But the data is interpreted and theorized
about as much as the ideas that motivated the search for the data. And there
are multiple interpretations for a piece of data. So the next step to the thing is
that an interpretation needs to be predictive. This helps narrow down theories more. But
this does not remove the circularity initially created by theorizing about the
data. It only helps to constrain it. It is also goofy in the sense that the
first theory has more value than subsequent, and better thought out theories.<br><br>
There is another issue too, there is too much going on. So a theory and its
evidence are just a whisper of what happened after being passed around so much.
Full grown adults can then tell tall tales, because they trust someone else's truth
instead of verifying it for themselves. We all seem to live in the past (duh),
and in a much more simple universe. It is all so.. <b>suboptimal</b>.<br><br>
<br><br>
Anyway, when science sounds magical, that is because it started out as
someone's imagination. We should do statistical tests on the sillier theories
first. Leave a more magical world-view for future generations.<br><br>
