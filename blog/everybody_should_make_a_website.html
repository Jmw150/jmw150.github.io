  <h2>everybody should make a website</h2>
Web design is oddly easy. <br><br>

Sure, video games can be written to run on the browser. And, web design is a
large, not particularly planned out, mess with hundreds of ways to do just
about anything. And, every web dev has an opinion about the proper way to work
this Frankenstein-ian kludge of software. It can be really complicated.<br><br>

But starting something simple takes about a day. It is a free form of expression. It can be as big as a person wants, it is an endless canvas.<br><br>

It may get easier. I am looking forward to web assembly. To be fair, web assembly looks like it will be like C is for hardware. Not everything that happens in networks in the last 50 years is going to make it into web assembly. It is not the set of network instructions, like assembly codes are for a particular architecture. But this is probably better. Very few of the thousands of instructions in x86 are targeted by compilers. Assembly instructions are not even the whole story, psuedo-ops and pipelines, and all of that stuff exists. But anyway, it is a metaphor. Attempting and standardizing a core of operation is great news. And it seems like all the major players in web stuff investing time into the project. So I think it will be successful.<br><br>

Right now the default html/css/javascript combo is a bunch of random noise to memorize. Talking directly to the hypertext transfer protocol is how languages like PHP work. But all of this shrinks pools of applicants that can do web development, and makes web developers expensive. The bigger issue is that there is so much poor design, the lifetime of web developers is very short. There is a turnover rate of about 5 years, many of these people spending 3-4 years in some school training up for the job.<br><br>
