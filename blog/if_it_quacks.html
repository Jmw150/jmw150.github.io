<h2>If It Quacks</h2>
If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck.. It is a duck up to talking and
walking homomorphisms.<br><br>
But really, we never seem to find good bounds on when objects are the same.
Behavior is tracked, and that is an in-place method of making equivalence
classes. But, somebody found it disturbing that Star Trek teleporters are killing
and cloning people. Or classical example of the Ship of Theseus was kind of odd.<br><br>
But there is not really anything to be said about objects that have infinite
attributes, in general. In the mind, without a finite representation of
attributes, there is no proof of uniqueness.<br><br>
Can we really prove anything is all that we think of them, even numbers?
Something like 2000 has a different meaning between minds. The mind of
mathematician might pick it apart for all of the primes, groups with as many
elements, etc. To another, it was the year they got married. It is an integer,
a string of letters, a real number.<br><br>
<b>You think, therefore I am.</b> Really, if you knew not enough about me to
distinguish me as a separate entity, I could be any of billions of people.
Un-experimental theories like this make up our understanding of the universe.<br><br>
