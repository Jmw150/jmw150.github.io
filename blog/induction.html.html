<h2>Induction</h2>
So on a walk I was thinking about type theory. The way to prove a type exists is to give an element of that type. So this is induction. What is odd is that the is also a method of proof for statistical things. Not the statistical math itself, but when it is used, an element must be provided of a distribution. <br><br>
So why not just one element? A given element observed is not known to be of the type needed. Normally it is some rational number, or we are approximating a real number. Real numbers are elements of distributions, but by themselves are not structured enough to prove that distribution. So what is done is more real numbers are found, with the hope that the distribution is depicted. <br><br>
What is commonly considered is statistics on some infinity sized model. Else a complete depiction could be given. Well, that is not true. What is observed is some element of an equivalence class of the desired structure. So the observation needs to be obvious and the structure not infinite. Well, that is not true. The chance of the observation being a real one is based on the space of possible observations. The space of observations is not based on some finite model, to most people, right?<br><br>
So to massage away the issue of the negative cases of the last 2 issues stated, more data is searched for. But type theory does not have these problems. Infinite objects can trivially be provided. So inductive reasoning in type theory is actually pretty strong, despite conventional feeling that come from a statistical based world view.<br><br><br><br>
Also mathematical induction is a dumb name. Sequential proofs, or something, would have been much better.
