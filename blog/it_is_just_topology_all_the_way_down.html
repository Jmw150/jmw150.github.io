<h2>It Is Just Topology All The Way Down</h2>
Real numbers, for example, on an interval (0,1] have numbers approaching 0
endlessly. Spaces can <b>totally</b> be bottomless, like that <a href="
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down ">thing with the
turtles</a>.<br><br>
But it is also, there is a fairly interesting property that has been found
along side <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/computational+trilogy">logic
and computation</a>. And also <a href=" https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340
">physics</a> to some extent.<br><br>
This is interesting paradigm that is useful in machine learning. There are
spaces, and we can search them. They can pose as intelligence. Hell, they are
probably are intelligence.  When all of the new tech balances out and becomes
the norm, we may find many more computer science students to be fairly well
acquainted with topology. It is another angle to get at logic and automation.<br><br>
The idea of topology is to study “spaces” with “continuous functions” between
them. Specifically one considers functions between sets (whence “point-set
topology”) such that there is a concept for what it means that these functions
depend continuously on their arguments, in that their values do not “jump”.
Such a concept of continuity is familiar from analysis on metric spaces,
(recalled below) but the definition in topology generalizes this analytic
concept and renders it more foundational, generalizing the concept of metric
spaces to that of topological spaces. <br><br>
Hence, topology is the study of the category whose objects are topological
spaces, and whose morphisms are continuous functions. This category is much
more flexible than that of metric spaces, for example it admits the
construction of arbitrary quotients and intersections of spaces. Accordingly,
topology underlies or informs many and diverse areas of mathematics, such as
functional analysis, operator algebra, manifold/scheme theory, hence algebraic
geometry and differential geometry, and the study of topological groups,
topological vector spaces, local rings, etc. Not the least, it gives rise to
the field of homotopy theory, where one considers also continuous deformations
of continuous functions themselves (“homotopies”). Topology itself has many
branches, such as low-dimensional topology or topological domain theory.<br><br>
