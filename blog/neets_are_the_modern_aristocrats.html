<h2>Neets Are The Modern Aristocrats</h2>
NEET, an acronym for "Not in Education, Employment, or Training"<br><br>
Harvard mathematicians admits that "In theory, a future research mathematician should be able to go through all three stages [of becoming a mathematician] with the help of only a good library." [<a href="https://www.math.harvard.edu/graduate/guide-to-graduate-study/" target="_blank">1</a>]<br><br>
A person that has their expenses taken care of, has a computer, but does not
need to fit completely into one of these categories (Education, Employment,
Training), to get by, has a lot of potential.  They are living a lot better
than an Athenian from Ancient Greece. And they have a lot more influence as
well in many ways.<br><br>
It is the free time that made an aristocrat most I think. Sure, wealth is nice too.
But everything is so cheap now anyway. Rich people used to buy boats and throw
balls. How boring/inconsequential does that sound?<br><br>
Having so much free time would mean being able to learn things without dogma or
a profit motive. Work can be about impact, instead of the bottom line. From my
perspective, as someone in math and philosophy, this freedom of time separates
fairly good philosophers and mathematicians from kind of average ones. Chasing
the job is something that needs to be done though for most people. But it is a
compromise. Nobody really gets to 100% of where they aimed to be. Not really.
We all still need to eat, even if the food is not the main concern.<br><br>
