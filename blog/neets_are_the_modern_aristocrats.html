<h2>Neets Are The Modern Aristocrats</h2>
NEET, an acronym for "Not in Education, Employment, or Training"<br><br>
It is kind of silly to state what I did in the title. A homeless person could
be called a NEET too. But I mean, a person that has their expenses taken care of, has a
computer, but does not need to fit completely into one of these categories
(Education, Employment, Training), to get by. They are living a lot better than
an Athenian from Ancient Greece. And they have a lot more influence as well in
many ways.<br><br>
It is the free time that made an aristocrat I think. Sure, wealth is nice too.
But everything is so cheap anyway. Rich people used to buy boats and throw
balls. How boring/inconsequential does that sound?<br><br>
That seemed to be the message that I got from Aristotle's Ethics at least.
Having so much free time would mean being able to learn things without dogma or
a profit motive. Work can be about impact, instead of the bottom line. From my
perspective, as someone in math and philosophy, this freedom of time separates
fairly good philosophers and mathematicians from kind of average ones. Chasing
the job is something that needs to be done though for most people. But it is a
compromise. Nobody really gets to 100% of where they aimed to be. Not really.
We all still need to eat, even if the food is not the main concern.<br><br>
