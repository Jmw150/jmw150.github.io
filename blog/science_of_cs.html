<h2> The Best of Computer Science</h2>
I think computer science, as it can be called a science, is a formal science,
predominantly. Many areas of CS such as operating system research and robotics,
can, and should, be considered computer engineering. Engineering is a noble
pursuit but the culture of engineering is about the creation of things.
Creation is the discovery of engineering.  

<br>
<br>
But what is left? The computer scientists that are also Logicians, Linguists,
or Cognitive Scientists. 

<br>
<br>
<b>Logicians and Linguists</b>
<br>
Ever since Wittgenstein, Logic as a practice has been explained as a language
game. I have taken this to be that the kind of language game that
fits a few criteria: consistency, precision, and predictability. Playing
the game well means trying to optimize these three criteria. If a system is not
consistent, then all things are possible. While it is possible to do this, to
lie, in common language.  It is also important to know when someone is telling
the truth. Our world in general is also filled with what-is and what-is-not,
and computing is very much the same. It is to a similar benefit that
computation is explored logically like this. For example, it is <i>not</i>
possible in general to tell if a program will halt, many algorithms <i>do</i>
have a bound of O(n). Knowing these things with precision means computers can
be complex without being full of bugs.  When I say predictability, I mean
Logic's ability to build a universe from a much smaller one. To be able to
understand this in computing is a form of discovery. A 32 bit computer has 2^32
possible programs. By some grammar, maybe, only a 1/10th of these programs fit
the grammar.  And then by some type theory, maybe, only 1/1000th of the
programs will do the correct task by specification. This was a deductive
process, a formally scientific process.

<br>
<br>
<b>Cognitive Scientists</b>
<br>
Contemporary Cognitive Scientists are concerned with (artificial) intelligence,
and how learning happens. Many outside of the discipline do not acknowledge AI
as a real concept. But this is reductionist. The mind-like behavior is there
already. And the path of what can be done with AI is already laid out by
similar disciplines: philosophy of the mind, psychology, epistemology, etc...
It is possible to explain much of AI using optimization and
linear algebra. But all the same, this would put AI into the first category. In
total cognition like things are also a space that is about discovery instead of
purely creation.
