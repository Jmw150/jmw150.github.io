<h2>What Is The Physical</h2>
I think physicality may be similar to syllables. The distinction between what is
and is not physical may be a thing that human beings naturally intuit. And it
is a definition that humans adhere to for similar functional reasons. But with
the modern need for clarity and precision, physics may not be able to hide in
the human subconscious as a meaningful category.<br><br>
Also, side note, and to cut off the obvious escape into a seemly larger
category, metaphysics is a stacked tuple that came with a name based on its
order in a book series, not some property relating to modern physics. It
turns out <a href="
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphysics/
">metaphysics proper</a> is: 'first philosophy’,
‘first science’, ‘wisdom’, and ‘theology’. Not a study devoted to matters that
transcend the mundane concerns of Newton and Einstein and Heisenberg. With so
many first-* statements, it would make metaphysics seem meta. But Aristotle, if
I remember the readings of those books, goes on about the basics of things, and
ends with deep understanding and belief. So, alas, no superset of concerns along this route.<br><br>
Back to the question of what is physical, another classic trap is relying on
what is called sense data. This is where odd questions like "is math real?"
come from. I do not think such arguments survived to the modern age though. [<a href="
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sense-data/#ObjSenDat
">1</a>] What seems to work for now is abstract structures. Given evidence of some kind for such a structure is then sufficient to demonstrate it can be relied upon for daily work.<br><br>
