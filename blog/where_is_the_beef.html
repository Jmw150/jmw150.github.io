  <h2>where is the beef</h2>
What is the biggest intellectual game out there? <br><br>
What has the most meat on it, the thing that gives the most answers, solves the
most problems, and can payout within a person's lifetime? <br><br>
I think the answer is in logic. And therefore everyone should study logic, as
much as they can. I hear people talking about how science is about what is, and
engineering is about what can be. This duality also seems to extend into the
world of metaphysics/physics and logic. It is important to study the physics of
things, as much as that is a sane use of time. But logic can be applied to
unsound axioms. A focus on methods is, in my opinion, more useful than
consuming facts and compressing them down to make room for more facts.<br><br>
As an aside, there is another homomorphism, data-programs. Any programmer that
has taken time to program in lisp is familiar with this equality. From the
above paragraph it would seem that physics and logic form a similar
homomorphism.  Really, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340">they do</a>.
So sometimes while studying logic, basically it will look like other subjects.<br><br>
Logic has a lot to offer. When someone understands something from either a
logic, computation, or spaces, it can considered a step forward in human
knowledge. Logic gets at the fundamentals of knowledge.<br><br>
Why not math? I have a degree in math. Math is often used as the system that
scientists praise for providing good tools to work with, and sometimes given a
physical level of certainty. "Well, the math works out." But math, as much as
it can be used on most disciplines, is by nature extensional of itself, and
analytic. It works to further explain what already exists. And math is about
itself. Mathematicians should be free to study mathematics, not be expected to
solve all of causality in the universe.<br><br>
