<h2>Why A Logician</h2>
Why do I call myself a logician? Why call myself anything at all? Is not being
an X risking the tribalistic thought that can come from of belonging to a
group? Should not a person be more than just their job, or hobby? <br><br>
Yes of course. But, I am fairly dedicated to what I consider logic as a
discipline, and its subject-matter. I am other things, a computer scientist from my
work in AI, and probably 2-3 different kinds of engineer. But these are
byproducts of loving automation and embodying strengths of being a <a href="
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg_anthropology" >cyborg</a>. I still put it
on my main page. It makes it easy on employers. All computer scientists should
be able to make lucrative software anyway. And I have worked in the most common
field of computer-science science, <a href="
https://arxiv.org/about/reports/submission_category_by_year" 
>machine learning</a>. To be fair, I love AI.<br><br>
I could consider myself a philosopher, and I do. But philosophy is omnicognant,
and does not have some sort of real license associated with it. Analytic
philosophy has a bit more of a criteria for separating good from bad
philosophy. I am more into methods than applying methods of logic though. Logic
is a branch of philosophy to most philosophers. So I am a logician to philosophers.<br><br>
I also love to do mathematics. But non-scientists tend to think that means
elementary algebra. After more than half a decade, this got old. There is also
the problem that the definition of mathematics can be oddly indirect even
canonically.  Mathematics is old, but the tail end of the subject looks nothing
like the main history of it. The stuff from the last 150 years, looks very
little like the last 2000. Even the last 10 years looks somewhat alien to
something 100 years ago. There are maybe also 20 different schools thought
about what mathematics actually is. Nobody will agree on this. Lastly, even by canonical
mathematicians, most research output in mathematics is <a href="
https://arxiv.org/about/reports/submission_category_by_year" >applied topics</a>: 
differential equations, optimization and control, etc. This
mathematics is not what I do at all. Same species
maybe, but totally different breed, with different motivations. I care about
topology and algebra, basically topics that can be tied to logic anyway. So to
mathematicians I am a logician.<br><br>
I could say I am a linguist. I am certainly obsessing over word meanings
enough. Wittgenstein made the relationship between logic and language really
obvious. But within this, I am pulled towards formal and computational
semantics, and semiotics. I am a big Charles Sanders Peirce fan. Which makes me
a logician to linguists.<br><br>
So logician just about captures it.
