  <h2>why are proofs hard</h2>
Well, depending on the context, they are not really actually. But in
undergraduate mathematics and sciences that rely on mathematics, it may seem
so.<br><br>
What can make proofs have a magical air to them in mathematics courses is the
lack of clear explanation about what they are historically, and how we
eventually arrived at teaching first order logic in introductory courses.<br><br>
To start, a proof, historically, is an argument that is meant to convince
another person of something. If the other person is incredibly gullible, a
proof can be done with the same effort of a making a charismatic statement. Bad
evidence of a possible truth is completely possible to be given. Proofs are not
constructing the eternal, or are magic.  <br><br>
Proofs are all about the recipient. Providing proof of something in
math/logic/philosophy is intended to be more productive. ('cause magic genius
genes, but really) The recipient in this case is supposed to be trained in a
few ways: in more exact language, and with the cultural knowledge of what
reasoning leads to poor results. With this community reading what is being
proven, there is a higher hope for the proof of a fact being good.  <br><br>
But it is important to not consider this style of language and reason a
prescription. It is a convergent form. Misinterpretation happens in mathematics
if the object of study is nuanced enough. The reality of this kept mathematics
from going beyond euclidean and arithmetical topics for centuries. In the 1850s
some thinkers became pretty creative. 
Logical form was being given algebraic structure. An idea of a domain
of discourse was being used to allow logical sentences to be sound based on
content instead of just form. <br><br>
From this new precision, intellectuals of the time got drunk on the new power
of formalization. But what was also invited was complexity. Understanding and
taming complexity is a feat that took half a century of working with digital
computers to succeed at. So this is why first order logic is taught in an
introduction to proofs course, and then promptly disregarded for the rest of
many mathematicians careers. New results are exciting, oddly more so than
reliable results. This is due to correctness by consensus. <br><br>
This newfound precision also pointed out problems with past results.
Arithmetical statements, as stated in the Peano formalization, are recursive.
Unbound recursion is the cause of many logical paradoxes. So, remember the
problem of prescription of language I mentioned earlier? Due to treating
mathematics as mystical, eternal, and all connected, the culturally distinct
idea of logical precision is blamed, instead of poor reasoning.  <br><br>
Formal proofs are not automatically correct. They are proofs taken from a list
of possible inferences, instead of a more vague collective knowledge of good
reasoning versus bad. And the language is naturally mechanical, so it is easier
to grasp through use in computing. Many important things can be done in this
formal, more computational, setting. <br><br>
But, the recipient is what matters for a proof to work. Proofs are sophistry.
Proofs are communal rituals.  <br><br>
It is your life. It is also up to you what you consider proven.
