<h2>Why Even Have A Blog</h2>
I do not know really. <br><br>
I like thinking and talking. I think my insights should be shared, without
cost. I do not meet very many people that think exactly like I do. Although
that may just be a lack of social skills to find such people.<br><br>
There are millions of researchers across the world. Generic information is
basically free. And I may not have anything really novel to add. But it is good
practice for me to try to form my thoughts, instead of just being some sort of
sponge for arcane knowledge and producer of programs. And even though there is
such a deluge of information, I say it is not at max capacity. A decade or two
ago there were not memes about advanced mathematics. There is no way to track
all of it, but I would say our shared knowledge about everything is getting
deeper. Not to mention there are algorithms to sort through it all now.<br><br>
Some people just write a lot. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz wrote enough to fill a
library room. Only a few of his ideas are read by many, but they really enriched
society by being written. Half of Newton's writings where metaphysical things
instead of his physics stuff.<br><br>
So... Blog!
