<h2>Write More Notes</h2>
I like thinking and talking. I think my insights should be shared, without
cost. I do not meet very many people that think exactly like I do. Although
that may just be a lack of social skills to find such people.<br><br>
There are millions of researchers across the world. Generic information is
basically free. And I may not have anything really novel to add. But it is good
practice for me to try to form my thoughts, instead of just being some sort of
sponge for arcane knowledge and producer of programs. And even though there is
such a deluge of information, I say it is not at max capacity. A decade or two
ago there were not memes about advanced mathematics. There is no way to track
all of it, but I would say our shared knowledge about everything is getting
deeper. Not to mention there are algorithms to sort through it all now.<br><br>
Some people just write a lot. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz wrote enough to fill a
library room. Only a few of his ideas are read by many, but they really enriched
society by being written. Good professors seem to have something new to say each year.<br><br>
An academic should write more notes as they go through life experiences.<br><br>
I think I have a decent memory for things that I like. It was enough to get
through primary school and undergrad without taking any notes. I can just pay
attention in class and remember enough to get an A. To help soak up more for a
tough class, I would read the book first. Taking brief notes in class is
probably best. But it is good to take those notes and expand on them after the
class.<br><br>
Graduate school it is different. For one, the space of knowledge a person is
expected to work with is the entire modern field of whatever is being studied.
The second, a person in graduate school is expected to teach this stuff for
some reason. That reason, is why notes are important to take.<br><br>
I have, for years, tutored people in math and computer things. I tend to talk
at my level of understanding though. I have the patience to slow down if that
does not work. And I can usually be patient until the information clicks.<br><br>
But teaching a class, or giving a seminar, are sadly different. I have to talk
in the absence of receiving communication for about an hour. And what is said
has to make sense on the first pass for as many people listening as possible.
This can be done organically. But there is a stark contrast for most people
between a planned speech and an impromptu one. Taking notes is a simple way to
analyse and improve one's own knowledge and delivery.<br><br>
