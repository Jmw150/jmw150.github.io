<h2>Ece 664 Computability, Complexity, And Languages</h2>

<b>Motivation:</b> <br>
- Computability: In this case naive computability. For computer scientists it is the limitations of Turing machines (f : Nat -> Nat), which is arguably not as useful as it sounds. For mathematicians it is called recursion theory and it is more about paradoxes.<br><br>
- Complexity: In this case probably classical complexity. Complexity is about search spaces of (f : Nat -> Nat) phrased as problems. "Machine Learning" deals in functions on higher dimension, larger search spaces. So, despite what the professor for this class says, classical complexity is less relevant (if not incorrectly applied) on algorithms that handle larger spaces.<br><br>
- Languages: an area of programming all cs people should learn, because it unlocks the real potential in programming.<br><br>

- Why Study Computability, Complexity, and Languages?
<br>
This section is on motivating topics of the course. It is easy to sell me on most of his points, as I do not find being well-read to be a major crime against professional productivity.<br><br>
But I need some more evidence on some assertions made in this chapter.
- computability limitations versus type theory lack of limitations. (probably representation misnomer) <br>
- robot intelligence will not exceed human intelligence <br><br><br>
