<h2>Computability, Complexity, Languages
</h2>
<b>Motivation:</b><br>
I am taking this course because all of the other courses I am taking this semester look dead simple, and I don't want to be bored. This <br>
- Computability: In this case naive computability. For computer scientists it is the limitations of Turing machines (f : Nat -> Nat), which is arguably not as useful as it sounds. For mathematicians it is called recursion theory and it is more about paradoxes.
<br>
- Complexity: In this case probably classical complexity. Complexity is about search spaces of (f : Nat -> Nat) phrased as problems. "Machine Learning" deals in functions on higher dimension, larger search spaces. So, despite what the professor for this class says, classical complexity is less relevant (if not incorrectly applied) on algorithms that handle larger spaces.
<br>
- Languages: an area of programming all cs people should learn, because it unlocks the real potential in programming.
