<h2>Ece 664 Computability, Complexity, And Languages</h2>

<b>Motivation:</b> <br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Computability</b>: In this case naive computability. For computer scientists it is the limitations of Turing machines (f : Nat -> Nat), which is arguably not as useful as it sounds. For mathematicians it is called recursion theory and it is more about paradoxes.
 </li>
    <li><b>Complexity</b>: In this case probably classical complexity. Complexity is about search spaces of (f : Nat -> Nat) phrased as problems. "Machine Learning" deals in functions on higher dimension, larger search spaces. So, despite what the professor for this class says, classical complexity is less relevant (if not incorrectly applied) on algorithms that handle larger spaces.
 </li>
    <li><b>Languages</b>: An area of programming all CS people should learn, because it unlocks the real potential in programming.
 </li>
</ul>

Why Study Computability, Complexity, and Languages?
<br>
- This section is on motivating topics of the course. It is easy to sell me on most of his points, as I do not find being well-read to be a major crime against professional productivity.<br><br>
Mathematical Prerequisites <br>
- Beautiful stuff. The notation for first order logic is the familiar stuff from first semester Mendelson. <br>
- The guy is a Python programmer. I guess that makes sense for being a deep learning guy.<br><br>
<b>Questions</b><br>
- computability limitations versus type theory lack of limitations. (probably representation misnomer) <br>
- Robot intelligence will not exceed human intelligence?<br><br>
Off of the top of my head, the last is a weak argument on 2 accounts: <br>
(1.) Finite navigation over large infinite terrain is physical about the terrain,
not the navigation method. Ex. Having a library on methods versus inventing
from scratch. Deep learning is this on inherent topological structures in
reality.<br><br>
(2.) Computable is smaller than representable. Infinite structures can be described
and manipulated concretely with finite descriptions and morphisms. There are
limits to representation as well. But this is an argument against Turing
machines as a limitation on computation.
