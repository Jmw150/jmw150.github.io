<h2>Compilers</h2>

<b>Note</b>: Admittedly, my notes for this entire year are terrible. Everything was online. So I just rewatched parts of lectures if I forgot about something. And the course materials are copyrighted. So I am not allowed to share the main content of what was said or done. Sorry.

<br>
About time I got to take a compilers course. I have been wanting to get into
programming languages since sophomore year of undergrad. 
<br>
<br>
We made a C compiler to the Risc-V assembly language. The core insight I gained
from this: Many of the design features of C are so it will compile quickly on
the computers of the 1970s. But as a language it is annoying to build a
compiler for. It would be significantly easier to make compilers from lisp to
assembly as it would turn out.
<br>
<br>
Also, with modern compiler tools and maybe a month, anybody can make a good
chunk of the C language into machine level instructions. That is pretty much
what the Arduino people do. There are languages that it would simpler to do
this with (forth, lisp, some near-assembly lang) though. AT&T really left
behind a legacy with their language.
<br>
<br>
My enthusiasm for C programming kind of died in this class. C is old and
standard. Embedded systems are messy.
