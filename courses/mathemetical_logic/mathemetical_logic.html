<h2>Ma  585 Mathematical Logic</h2>

<b>Note</b>: Admittedly, my notes for this entire year are terrible. Everything was online. So I just rewatched parts of lectures if I forgot about something. And the course materials are copyrighted. So I am not allowed to share the main content of what was said or done. Sorry.
<br>
<br>
I have already taken a philosophical logic (pure-blooded logic) course. So I
may leave out some details, as those are trivial to me.
<br>
<br>
The online offering of Mathematical Logic is why I decided to go to main campus
Purdue for the pandemic of 2020. Purdue often ranking in the single digits in
the US, for engineering disciplines, was cool. But I am only a practical person
to pay the bills.
<br>
<br>
We covered propositional logic for about a week, and the dived into predicate
logic based model theory for 70% of the semester, finally finishing up with
formal number theory and the classic Gödel theorems.
<br>
<br>
Model are an amazing way to talk about mathematics. It is heavy. But this kind
of weight of tools is a good investment when working with high infinity objects
with concreteness. In the class models were treated as sacred and real thing.
But it is really just a design. A model can be pulled out of a logic. Stuff
like separation algebra exists as a model for separation logic.
<br>
<br>
Models are a lot like universal algebra and
algebraic geometry. The professors research subject is even in O-minimality,
which, from my understanding have a lot of connections to some types of
algebraic geometry.  
<br>
<br>
It seems like almost everybody is too gullible to read through Gödel's theorems
before talking about them. So it was nice to have these theorems given full
attention, and understanding of them taken for a grade. They are really very
specific theorems. They kick Hilbert's attempt at converting all of math to
classical number theory. That much I am even grateful for. Elementary number
theory has a just big enough infinity in it to be an inconsistent (or
incomplete) pain in the ass. Going down to finite systems, everything is
provable and consistent, if it was made to be. There are no surprises there.
And, simply taking off the + or * operators is also enough to make a natural
number level system complete. So it is not even that the use of infinity is at
fault. The problem is really in recursion. Pretty much all paradoxes are about self
reference problems. Recursion is one of the 4 big classical fields of
mathematical logic, somewhat due to this I think.
<br>
<br>
Mathematical logic is a giant field. We did not have time for Recursion Theory
or Set Theory. Luckily I took a separate course on at least <a
href="../set_theory/set_theory.html">Set Theory</a> this semester.
