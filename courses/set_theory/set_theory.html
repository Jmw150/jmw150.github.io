<h2>Ma  598 Set Theory</h2>

<b>Note</b>: Admittedly, my notes for this entire year are terrible. Everything was online. So I just rewatched parts of lectures if I forgot about something. And the course materials are copyrighted. So I am not allowed to share the main content of what was said or done. Sorry.
<br>
<br>
This class started from the foundations of set theory as they were talked about historically. 
<br>
<br>
The main insight I gathered from set theory is that of the classical
mathematical logic subjects, set theory is the study of infinity. This is the
main use of modern set theory it would seem.  It <b>can</b> be referred to as a
foundation of mathematics. But there are many foundations in the modern age of
mathematics. And to be fair, many mathematicians are not focussed enough on
methods and reliability of proofs. So concerns on methods and foundations are
left to the less gullible in the field.
<br>
<br>
The second is that a fairly common construct in set theory is different kinds
of numbers. But this second part may be more historical than realistic. This is
a valuable property for model theory, as model theory needs larger and larger
infinities of elements to toss around.
<br>
<br>
Another cool thing I found is set theory classically has some nice
computational elements to it. Unlike naive computability these elements are
almost always some high level infinity. It was proven that at least with ZF
sets, not doing so would end up with elements that work like regular numbers,
and that realistically any set theory would be excessive if it were not large.
