<h2>Ece 595 Advanced Software Engineering</h2>

<b>Note</b>: Admittedly, my notes for this entire year are terrible. Everything was online. So I just rewatched parts of lectures if I forgot about something. And the course materials are copyrighted. So I am not allowed to share the main content of what was said or done. Sorry.
<br>
<br>
    I learned that software engineering is a subset of system engineering.
    System engineering is actually novel. Software engineering before this
    class seemed to be all about middle management of the actual programmers,
    and using mathematical techniques to manage projects better.
<br>
<br>
    This was also a good course in the sense that we read current software
    engineering research articles and I was able to finish some actual
    scientific research in it.
