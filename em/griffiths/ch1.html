Chapter 1: Mathematical Language
</b>
<br>

Math objects mentioned so far are basically:
<br>
- lists with special operators and functors
<br>
-- Dirac delta as an incompatible cheat function (1d, 3d),
<br>
-- dot, cross, (gradient, div, curl),
<br>
-- line integral, base-change, tensors
<br>


Discussion points:
<br>
- Topological definition of continuity is kind of different than the physical
  one. I think on the discrete topology all elements are continuous.
<br>
<br>

- What is the idea behind electric charge? Was it part of the field theory that
  Maxwell was thinking of? What was the experiment used to demonstrate it? What
other properties does it predict? I am guessing push and pull of magnets led to
the idea.
<br>
<br>

- Physical and mathematical definitions of vectors and tensors are in fact
  different it seems.

<br>
<br>
- Is it really true that A dot B = 0 if A and B are perpendicular? Without
  |A||B|cos(theta), it would need some more work to show this to be true. Seems
like a complex analysis thing.
<br>
<br>

- Dot and cross product are kind of physical too. Like do these equations hold
  in a different metric space? Would they hold without a metric? They do not
hold on general vectors, only really on 2d and 3d ones.
<br>
<br>

- Dot and cross products have a nice set up of
  A dot B = |A||B|cos(theta), A cross B = |A||B|sin(theta) n
  Is this part of the design of the two operators?
<br>
<br>

- The cross product is not associative, but the composition of functions is.
  Why? Seems like composition is not defined for 2-arity functions. This has
kind of an odd property to it.
<br>
<br>

- A . (B x C) is the volume of a parallelpiped. BAC-CAB rule exists. Lots of
  computational shorthand. It kind of reminds me of old statistics books before
computers were invented. I can see it being a nice shorthand for being a
chalkboard-bounded physicist. But it seems like a bit much to mentally maintain
as a computational physicist, right?
<br>
<br>

- 1.31 is verbose. But the notation is nice and concise for describing 3d
  rotation. Quaternions could also work here I think.  b = Ax would have been
much less tedious too. In computing I would have just wrote out a function
definition for this special case though. And in higher level math that is also
what you would do,
<br>
<br>

- Differential geometry is a weird subject. It takes many of these unusual
  operators and runs with it. I think this is due to how interesting these
operators are geometrically. How did your general relativity class merge math
and physics versions of these objects?
<br>
<br>

- Why does the gradient point towards greatest descent? Looks like component
  derivatives. So it is going for the taxi metric sum of velocity.
<br>
<br>

- gradient, divergence, and curl are just functors. There is a more essential definition under them I think.
<br>
<br>

- gradient seems like it was thrown together. I don't get its design. But
  divergence and curl are actually kind of interesting. They split derivatives
on vectors into two familiar components seen in complex analysis: scale and
rotation of a+bi.
<br>
<br>

- Most of the 1.2.6 identities directly follow from elementary algebra
  identities. Seems kind of excessive to mention them.
<br>
<br>

- page 23 has the Laplacian. 
<br>
<br>


I am really curious how this stuff works in complex analysis, and a little in
differential geometry. DG is kind of a foil for physics, so it is probably
going to look a lot like its physical counterpart. But CA could give some weird
extra information about what is being said in this book. Possible computational
speedups because it is so polynomial-based.
<br>
<br>

Line integrals are surprisingly deep. Ch 1.5 and 1.6 look interesting and new to me. 
<br>
<br>

Overall, I have a feeling only a fraction of the math used in the intro is actually needed to work with EM. And the math is a bit dated.
