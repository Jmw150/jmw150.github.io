<b>Preface</b>
<br>
<br>
The easiest way to digest the contents of undergraduate electrodynamics
teaching is via tensors on complex numbers.

<br>
<br>
There are a few levels to think about tensors
<br>
- as defined in the book (physical)
<br>
- via the common category definition (common in algebra)
<br>
- as a model (the fullest definition that allows automated reasoning)
<br>
<br>
