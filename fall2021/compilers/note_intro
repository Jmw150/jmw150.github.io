<ul>
<li> Optimization in compilers technology is where most practical use of
algorithms is found. Algorithms analysis is used in an industrial setting for
compiler engineers. Compiler engineering teams are tasked with doing all the
clever thinking so regular programmers do not have to. </li>
<li> Code Generation in compiler tech leads into the far more impressive field
of program synthesis.</li>
