<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>
Logic; the language game of precision, consistency, and world building. Logic research is found predominantly within the fields of: philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and linguistics.
</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>

<li><b>Type Theory</b>: A grand unified theory of computation. Types classify constructions.

</li>
<br>
<li><b>Model Theory</b>: A discipline that is similar to the set of tools <a href="http://www.classicallibrary.org/descartes/meditations/">Descartes</a> would have used. Models sit on top of symbolic logic, and bear many similarities to algebraic geometry. They are the instances of programs, and the living breathing citizens of logical universes. Useful in

                ">
                Philosophy</a>,  
        and 
        <a href="
           https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_model_theory
                ">
                Computer Science</a>.

</li>
<br>
<li><b>Algebraic Topology</b>: Generally softer geometric equalities and structures. Topologies can be used to do things normally done with a logic, such as defining spaces for real analysis to work.

</li>
<br>
<li><b>Algebraic Geometry</b>: Multivariate polynomials, and structures defined as solutions to a larger series of equations. The magic (for me at least) of having a solution to an equation is a popular theme in algebraic geometry.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>Verification of programs</b>: What's it all about? It is about an approach to bringing software engineering up to speed with more traditional engineering disciplines, providing a mathematical foundation for rigorous analysis of realistic computer systems. As civil engineers apply their mathematical canon to reach high certainty that bridges will not fall down, the software engineer should apply a different canon to argue that programs behave properly. As other engineering disciplines have their computer-aided-design tools, computer science has proof assistants, IDEs for logical arguments. We can learn how to apply these tools to certify that programs behave as expected.

</li>
<br>
<li><a href="https://barghouthi.github.io/2017/04/24/synthesis-primer/"><b>Synthesis of programs</b></a>: The study of how to use language to generate programs. At highest reliability, such a language is a logic. But this discipline encompasses what compilers can generate from a given language, and what a machine learning program can do based on its specification.
