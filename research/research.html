 <h2>Research Interests</h2>
 <p>
<b>Logic</b>: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy)">language-game</a>
of precision, consistency, and world building. Working in logic can mean
working in such fields as: philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and
linguistics.  
 </p>
  <p>In particular:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><b>Type Theory</b>: A grand unified theory of computation. Types classify constructions.
    </li>
<!--
<br>
<li><b>Model Theory</b>: 
A discipline that is similar to the set of tools <a
href="http://www.classicallibrary.org/descartes/meditations/">Descartes</a>
would have used. Models sit on top of symbolic logic, and bear many
similarities to algebraic geometry. They are the instances of programs, and the
living breathing citizens of logical universes. Useful in <a href="
                https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Model-Theory-Tim-Button/dp/0198790406/
                ">Philosophy</a>,  
        and 
        <a href="
           https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_model_theory
                ">Computer Science</a>.
</li>
--> 
<br>
<li><b>Algebraic Topology</b>: Generally softer geometric equalities and
structures. Topologies can be used to do things normally done with a logic,
such as defining spaces for mathematical analysis to work.

</li>
<!--
<br>
<li><b>Algebraic Geometry</b>: 
Multivariate polynomials, and structures defined as solutions to a larger
series of equations. The magic (for me at least) of having a solution to an
equation is a popular theme in algebraic geometry. Looking into 
<a
href="
      https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~snburris/htdocs/MAL.pdf
">The Mathematical Analysis of Logic</a> you will find that the original
Boolean Algebra, the first logical species of mathematical structures, was
defined more as systems of equations, than the common operator based structure
found today in undergraduate texts.  

</li>
-->

<!--
<br>
<li><b>Constructive Mathematics</b>: 
Mathematics is grand, powerful, and even beautiful. But, I am not gullible, or
desperate for just any mathematics teaching job. So I can take my time, be more
constructive, and more intuitive about mathematical discoveries. Constructive
methods are more dependable, simple to verify, and translate between logics, or
into programs. 

-->
<br>
<li><b>Verification of programs</b>: 
What's it all about? It is about an approach to bringing software engineering
up to speed with more traditional engineering disciplines, providing a
mathematical foundation for rigorous analysis of realistic computer systems. As
civil engineers apply their mathematical canon to reach high certainty that
bridges will not fall down, the software engineer should apply a different
canon to argue that programs behave properly. As other engineering disciplines
have their computer-aided-design tools, computer science has proof assistants,
IDEs for logical arguments. We can learn how to apply these tools to certify
that programs behave as expected.
</li>
<br>
<li><a href="https://barghouthi.github.io/2017/04/24/synthesis-primer/"></a>
<b>Synthesis of programs</b>: 
The study of how to use language to generate programs. At highest reliability,
such a language is a logic. But this discipline encompasses what compilers can
generate from a given language, and what a machine learning program can do
based on its specification.
