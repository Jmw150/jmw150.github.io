<p><b>Summer of Logic</b></p>

This summer I am taking time for me and studying what I like, and that is mostly logic. To do this I am using CSrankings to grab every paper on formal methods and programming language theory. I am also looking through the last decade or so of material from the association of symbolic logic. And aside from that I am working through a few logic related courses, such as introduction to dependent type theories, software foundations, books on topology, category theory, abstract algebra.
<br>
<br>
I also took some time doing random things: trying to start a workshop on symbolic AI, learning about the electromagnetic force, and trying to get my fairly derivative research published.
<br>
<br>
